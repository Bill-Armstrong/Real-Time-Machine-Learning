# Real_Time-Machine-Learning
This repository is currently under construction. A demonstration program in C++ of a new approach to machine learning will be uploaded in a few days.  CUDA programmers will be interested in making it a few orders of magnitude faster using a GPU rather than on an i7 alone. Forget back-prop, this idea uses forward propagation of credit assignment. Also forget the black-box of CNNs: it will be very clear to you how this new idea works. See you back here in a few days!
