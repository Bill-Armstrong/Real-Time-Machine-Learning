** Learning Feature Trees** offer a new approach to machine learning with a few big surprises for the machine learning community:
1. How it does pattern recognition is **easily understood**, and it's **accurate** on the MNIST test set.
2. With enough parallel hardware, problems with many classes can take the **same time** as with few. Accuracy takes **no extra time**.
3. It uses **forward propagation** of credit assignment. Simple "engrams" identify weights to change even **much later** than an action.
4.It **builds the architecture by growing LF-trees**. Human intervention is for tasks like adapting the program to new data formats.
5. It's **free** under the MIT license. The goal is to make sure everyone always has access to the best this technology can offer.
